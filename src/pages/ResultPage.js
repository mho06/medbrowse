      <h3>Study {index + 1}: The Impact of Lifestyle on Cardiovascular Health</h3>
      <p>
        Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide.
        Numerous observational studies have assessed the impact of modifiable lifestyle
        factorsâ€”including diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and sleepâ€”
        on the risk of CVD. This meta-analysis evaluates the association between lifestyle
        patterns and CVD incidence across 28 prospective cohort studies involving over 1.2
        million participants and 52,000 cardiovascular events. Results show that individuals
        adhering to a healthy lifestyle had a 42% lower risk of developing CVD compared to
        those with poor lifestyle habits. These findings support the promotion of comprehensive
        lifestyle interventions as a public health priority.
